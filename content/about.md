I am a developer for embedded systems. I work on hardware as well as on
low-level software.

My current projects (apart from our two little sons, which don't leave much
time for other things right now):

* [SDuino](https://github.com/tenbaht/sduino): Adopting the Arduino environment for the STM8 MCU
* building a Shapeoko CNC mill
* [SMT pick and place machine](https://hackaday.io/project/158261-simple-pick-and-place-head):
  Develop and build, using DC motors from inkjet printers


Completed projects:

* Porting the [SMC3 DC motor controller](https://github.com/tenbaht/servo-motor-controller) for the
  ATmega328/Arduino Uno and for use with gcc.
* UV exposure unit for PCB prototyping (etching mask and solder mask)
* [reflow oven](/tags/reflow-oven/): Control electronics and software


Available tools:

* K40 laser cutter
* Anet A8 3D printer (amazing device, by the way)
* China CNC 3018 Pro (great kit in general, but QC is lacking)
* Small CNC for drilling and engraving PCBs (30 years old and still going
  strong)


Projects on hold:

* Easy workflow for KiCAD to produce ready-to-print pdfs for PCB exposure
