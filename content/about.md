I am a developer for embedded systems. I work on hardware as well as on
low-level software.

My current projects (apart from my one-year old son, which doesn't leave
much time for other things right now):

* [SDuino](https://github.com/tenbaht/sduino): Adopting the Arduino environment for the STM8 MCU
* building a Shapeoko CNC mill
* UV exposure unit for PCB prototyping (etching mask and solder mask)
* reflow oven: Control electronics and software
* [SMT pick and place machine](https://hackaday.io/project/158261-simple-pick-and-place-head):
  Develop and build, using DC motors from inkjet printers

Available tools:

* K40 laser cutter
* Anet A8 3D printer (amazing device, by the way)
* Small CNC for drilling and engraving PCBs

Projects on hold:

* Easy workflow for KiCAD to produce ready-to-print pdfs for PCB exposure
